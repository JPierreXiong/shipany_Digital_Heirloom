## Disclaimer for Afterglow (Digital Heirloom)

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Encryption & User Responsibility

Afterglow operates on a Zero-Knowledge architecture. This means your master password, encryption keys, or any part of Fragment A/B are never stored on our servers. If you lose these critical credentials, Afterglow and its technical team are legally and technically unable to recover your assets; all risks of data loss arising therefrom are borne solely by the user.

### 2. Legal Validity & Consultation

All information and tools provided by this platform are for technical reference only and do not constitute legal, financial, tax, or testamentary advice. The legal status of digital asset inheritance varies across jurisdictions; we strongly recommend users consult professional legal counsel to ensure your digital legacy plan complies with local laws.

### 3. Third-Party Platform Dependency

Afterglow's asset distribution functions may rely on third-party services (e.g., email providers, ShipAny logistics, blockchain networks, etc.). Afterglow shall not be held legally liable for distribution failures caused by third-party service interruptions, API changes, or network delays.

### 4. Plans & Service Limitations

Users must understand the limitations of different plan tiers, including the 180-day heartbeat frequency limit, 50MB storage limit, and decryption count limits for Free users. Failure to complete heartbeat check-ins within the prescribed time will trigger the preset inheritance process.

### 5. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Afterglow and its operators shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of our service, loss of credentials, or inability to recover assets due to zero-knowledge architecture limitations.

### 6. Contact Information
