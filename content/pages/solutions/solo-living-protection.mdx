## When You Live Alone, Who Will Access Your Digital Life?

You're independent, self-sufficient, and comfortable living solo. But have you considered what happens to your digital assets if you become incapacitated or pass away unexpectedly?

**The reality**: When living alone, there's no one nearby to notice if something goes wrong. Your subscriptions continue charging, your cloud storage fills up, and your digital accounts remain locked—potentially forever.

## The Solo Living Challenge

### The Subscription Problem

Modern life runs on subscriptions:

- **Streaming Services**: Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, Apple TV+
- **Cloud Storage**: iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox
- **Software Subscriptions**: Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365
- **Memberships**: Gym, clubs, professional associations
- **Financial Services**: Credit monitoring, investment platforms

When you're gone, these subscriptions continue charging your credit cards until the accounts are closed—but who will close them?

### The Account Access Gap

Even if you've shared passwords with family members:

- **2FA Barriers**: Two-factor authentication prevents access without your phone
- **Security Questions**: Answers only you knew
- **Biometric Locks**: Face ID, fingerprint scanners that only recognize you
- **Email Recovery**: Recovery emails sent to accounts no one can access

## Afterglow's Automated Solution

### How the Dead Man's Switch Works

1. **Setup**: You create a vault and add your digital assets (passwords, account information, instructions)
2. **Heartbeat Check-ins**: You periodically confirm you're active (every 30-180 days depending on your plan)
3. **Grace Period**: If you miss a check-in, Afterglow sends multiple email reminders
4. **Automated Release**: After the grace period expires, your designated beneficiaries receive access
5. **Asset Distribution**: Beneficiaries can access your accounts, cancel subscriptions, and transfer assets
