## Your Crypto Assets Deserve Better Than a Single Point of Failure

You've spent years building your crypto portfolio. Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, DeFi positions—each asset represents hours of research, strategic decisions, and financial planning. But what happens to these assets if something happens to you?

**The harsh reality**: Over $95 billion in cryptocurrency is permanently locked in wallets where the private keys have been lost or forgotten. Your heirs face an impossible task: accessing assets protected by encryption they cannot break.

## Why Traditional Methods Fail for Crypto

### The Multisig Problem

Many crypto investors rely on multisig wallets, believing that sharing keys with trusted parties provides security. However, this approach has critical flaws:

- **Single Point of Failure**: If one key holder becomes unavailable, the entire wallet becomes inaccessible
- **Security Risk**: Sharing private keys increases attack surface
- **No Automation**: Manual key recovery doesn't account for incapacitation scenarios
- **Legal Complexity**: Traditional wills cannot legally transfer private keys

### The "Write It Down" Trap

Some investors write down seed phrases or private keys in physical locations:

- **Physical Vulnerability**: Paper can be lost, damaged, or stolen
- **No Time-Based Release**: Keys are accessible immediately, even when you're still alive
- **No Verification**: No way to ensure the right person accesses assets at the right time

## Afterglow's Zero-Knowledge Solution

### True Client-Side Encryption

When you store your crypto keys in Afterglow, **encryption happens entirely in your browser**. Your Master Password never leaves your device. We use PBKDF2 key derivation with thousands of iterations to transform your password into a secure encryption key.

**Result**: Only encrypted ciphertext reaches our servers. Even if our infrastructure were compromised, attackers would see only random data—your private keys remain mathematically protected.

### The Heartbeat Mechanism

Afterglow uses an intelligent "Dead Man's Switch" system:

- **Free Tier**: Check in every 180 days to confirm you're active
- **Base Plan**: Check in every 90 days
- **Pro Plan**: Check in every 30 days

If you miss a heartbeat, the system enters a grace period with multiple email reminders. Only after the grace period expires without activity does the inheritance process begin.

### Fragment A/B: Eliminating Single Points of Failure

For Pro users, Afterglow introduces **Fragment A/B Physical Splitting**:

- **Fragment A (Cloud)**: Encrypted shard stored on secure servers—cannot decrypt alone
- **Fragment B (Physical)**: Unique decryption component delivered via ShipAny physical mail or held by a designated beneficiary—cannot decrypt alone

**Security Logic**: Both fragments must be combined to access your vault. This mirrors real-world safety deposit boxes—even if Fragment A is compromised (cloud breach) or Fragment B is lost (physical theft), your assets remain secure.

## Technical Deep Dive: Zero-Knowledge Proof Architecture

### How It Works

1. **Encryption**: Your Master Password derives a symmetric key via PBKDF2
2. **Fragmentation**: For Pro plans, the decryption key is split into Fragment A (cloud) and Fragment B (physical)
3. **Storage**: Only encrypted data is stored on Afterglow servers
4. **Trigger**: Heartbeat system detects inactivity and initiates inheritance workflow
5. **Release**: Beneficiaries authenticate using release tokens and (for Pro) Fragment B
6. **Decryption**: Fragments combine to reconstruct the key and decrypt your vault

### Quantum Computing Security

Afterglow's encryption uses industry-standard algorithms that are resistant to quantum computing attacks. We continuously monitor cryptographic research and update our systems to maintain security against emerging threats.

## FAQ: Crypto Inheritance

### How do I know my private keys are secure?

Afterglow uses **zero-knowledge encryption**, meaning your keys are encrypted before leaving your browser. Our servers never see your raw private keys or Master Password. Even if our infrastructure were compromised, attackers would only see encrypted data.

### What happens if Afterglow shuts down?

For Pro users with Fragment A/B, your Fragment B (physical component) ensures you can decrypt your vault even if Afterglow's servers are unavailable. The encryption is standard and can be decrypted using open-source tools if needed.

### Can my heirs access my crypto without knowing blockchain technology?

Yes. Afterglow provides clear instructions and support to help beneficiaries access your assets, even if they're not familiar with cryptocurrency.

### How do I transfer NFTs?

NFTs are transferred the same way as other crypto assets—by securely storing the private keys or seed phrases that control the wallet holding the NFTs. Your beneficiaries can then access and transfer the NFTs using standard wallet software.

### What about DeFi positions and yield farming?

Afterglow can store the private keys needed to access DeFi positions. We recommend documenting your DeFi strategy and providing instructions to beneficiaries about how to manage or exit positions.

### Is this legal?

Yes. Afterglow facilitates the legal transfer of digital assets through automated inheritance workflows. We recommend consulting with an estate planning attorney familiar with digital assets to ensure compliance with local laws.

### How much does it cost?

- **Free**: Basic crypto inheritance with 180-day heartbeat
- **Base**: Enhanced security with 90-day heartbeat
- **Pro**: Fragment A/B physical splitting with 30-day heartbeat and ShipAny physical mail
