## Your Creator Business Shouldn't Die With You

You've built a YouTube channel, a brand, and a business. Thousands of hours of content, a loyal audience, and recurring revenue from AdSense, sponsorships, and merchandise.

**The reality**: When a creator passes away, their business assets often become inaccessible. YouTube channels remain locked, AdSense accounts can't be transferred, and brand assets are lost forever.

## The Creator Inheritance Problem

### The YouTube Brand Account Challenge

YouTube Brand Accounts are designed for business continuity, but transferring ownership after death is complex:

- **Manager vs. Owner**: Only the owner can transfer ownership, but owners often don't set up managers properly
- **AdSense Association**: AdSense accounts are tied to personal Google accounts, not Brand Accounts
- **Revenue Access**: Without proper setup, heirs can't access accumulated AdSense revenue
- **Channel Content**: Years of videos and community content may become inaccessible

### The Business Asset Gap

Creators accumulate valuable digital assets:

- **YouTube Channels**: Content libraries, subscriber bases, monetization
- **AdSense Accounts**: Accumulated revenue, payment methods
- **Sponsorship Contracts**: Ongoing partnerships, brand deals
- **Merchandise Stores**: Print-on-demand accounts, inventory
- **Social Media Accounts**: Instagram, TikTok, Twitter brand accounts
- **Domain Names**: Website ownership, email hosting
- **Content Libraries**: Raw footage, editing files, brand assets

## Afterglow's Creator Solution

### How It Works

1. **Document Your Assets**: Create a comprehensive inventory of all creator business assets
2. **Store Access Credentials**: Save passwords, recovery codes, and account information

## YouTube Channel Transfer: Step-by-Step Guide

## FAQ: Creator Business Continuity

### Can I transfer my YouTube channel to someone else while I'm alive?

Yes. You can transfer ownership of a YouTube Brand Account to another Google account at any time through YouTube Studio → Settings → Permissions. However, this requires the current owner to be active.

### What happens to my AdSense revenue if I die?

If properly documented in Afterglow, your successors can access your AdSense account information and work with Google to transfer accumulated revenue. However, the process requires legal documentation (death certificate, will, etc.).

### Can my family continue making videos on my channel?

Yes, if you've set up Managers on your Brand Account and provided them with access credentials through Afterglow. They can continue uploading content and managing the channel.

### What about ongoing sponsorship contracts?

Store all sponsorship contract information, contact details, and renewal dates in your Afterglow vault. Your successors can then contact sponsors to renegotiate or transfer contracts.

### How do I protect my brand assets?

Document all brand assets in your Creator Asset Inventory:
- Logo files and brand guidelines
- Social media account credentials
- Domain and website ownership
- Trademark information (if applicable)

### What if I have multiple YouTube channels?

You can document all channels in your Afterglow vault. Create separate entries for each channel with its own credentials, managers, and transfer instructions.

### Is this legal?

Yes. Afterglow facilitates the legal transfer of digital business assets. We recommend consulting with a business attorney familiar with digital assets to ensure proper estate planning for your creator business.
