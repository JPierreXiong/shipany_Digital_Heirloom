## Your Family Photos Deserve to Live On

You've captured thousands of precious moments: first steps, birthdays, holidays, graduations. These photos live in your iCloud, Google Photos, or Dropbox—protected by passwords and two-factor authentication that only you know.

**The problem**: When you're gone, your family faces the "2FA Gap"—they can't access your accounts because they don't have your phone, your security questions, or your biometric authentication.

## The 2FA Gap: A Modern Inheritance Crisis

### What Is the 2FA Gap?

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is essential for security, but it creates a barrier for inheritance:

- **Phone-Based 2FA**: Codes sent to your phone that only you can access
- **App-Based 2FA**: Authenticator apps on your device
- **Biometric Locks**: Face ID, fingerprint scanners
- **Security Questions**: Answers only you knew

**Result**: Even if your family has your passwords, they can't access your accounts without your 2FA device.

### The Emotional Cost

Imagine your children trying to access:
- **Family Photos**: Years of memories locked in iCloud
- **Home Videos**: Precious moments they can't retrieve
- **Digital Scrapbooks**: Stories and memories you created
- **Shared Albums**: Photos you meant to share but never got around to

These aren't just files—they're irreplaceable family history.

## Afterglow's Solution: Bypassing the 2FA Barrier
