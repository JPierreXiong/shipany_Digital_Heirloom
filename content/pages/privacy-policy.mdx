**Effective Date: January 15, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

Afterglow ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. We operate on a **Zero-Knowledge Encryption** architecture, ensuring that your sensitive data remains private and accessible only to you and your designated beneficiaries. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our platform, website, and services.

## 2. Data We Collect

Under the principle of data minimization, we only collect information essential for our service:

**Identity & Contact Data**: Email address. Purpose: Account creation, authentication, heartbeat alerts, and critical system notifications.

**Financial & Transaction Data**: Payment records and subscription tier (Free/Base/Pro). We do not store full credit card numbers; payments are processed via trusted third-party processors (e.g., Stripe, Creem).

**Technical & Usage Data**: IP address, browser type, heartbeat check-in frequency, and login records. Purpose: Security monitoring, fraud prevention, and server performance optimization.

**Encrypted Vault Data**: This is your uploaded content. **Critical Note**: This data is encrypted locally on your device before transmission. Since we do not hold your master password or private keys, we cannot decrypt, view, or process your vault contents.

## 3. Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Our service core is "local encryption." This means:

- Encryption and decryption processes occur solely within your client (browser or App).
- Your Master Password is never transmitted to our servers.
- **Risk Warning**: If you lose your Master Password or physical fragments (Fragment A/B), we cannot recover your data.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

For users subject to GDPR, we process your personal data based on:

- **Contractual Necessity**: To provide vault hosting and asset distribution services.
- **Legal Obligation**: For tax record-keeping or regulatory compliance.
- **Legitimate Interests**: To optimize our service security and prevent illegal use.

## 5. Cookies and Third-Party Technologies

We use cookies to enhance your experience:

**Essential Cookies**: For maintaining your login session.

**Analytics & Advertising Cookies**: We use Google Analytics and Google AdSense. These third-party services may use cookies to collect information about your visits to this website and other websites to serve ads that may interest you. You can opt-out of cookies at any time via your browser settings.

## 6. Data Retention Policy

**Active Accounts**: We retain your data for as long as your account is active.

**Inactive Status**: For Free tier users, if a heartbeat check-in is missed for over 180 days and no inheritance process is configured, related metadata will be flagged as inactive and processed according to our sanitization protocols within a reasonable period.

## 7. Your Rights

Under GDPR, you have the following rights:

**Access & Rectification**: You can view and modify your personal profile at any time.

**Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: You can request account deletion and removal of all associated data.

**Data Portability**: You can request export of your account metadata.

**Note**: Due to zero-knowledge encryption, we cannot recover encrypted content if you lose your credentials.

## 8. Third-Party Services

**Email Providers**: We use Resend for sending notifications and alerts.

**Payment Processors**: Financial transactions are secured by third-party payment providers (Stripe, Creem).

**Logistics**: Pro plan users may utilize ShipAny for physical shipping services.

**No Data Selling**: We do not sell or trade your personal data to third parties.

## 9. Data Security

**Storage**: We store encrypted vault data and account metadata in secure cloud storage.

**Security**: We use industry-standard encryption to ensure your content remains private. Due to zero-knowledge architecture, even we cannot decrypt your vault contents.

## 10. Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 11. International Data Transfers

Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your jurisdiction. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of significant changes via email or through our platform.
