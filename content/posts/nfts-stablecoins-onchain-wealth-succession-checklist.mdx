## The Modern Crypto Portfolio: Beyond Bitcoin

In 2026, a crypto portfolio is no longer just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Modern investors hold:
- **NFTs**: Digital art, collectibles, gaming assets
- **Stablecoins**: USDT, USDC, DAI for yield farming
- **DeFi Positions**: Liquidity pools, staking, lending
- **RWA Tokens**: Tokenized real estate, bonds, commodities
- **Governance Tokens**: DAO participation, voting rights
- **Layer 2 Assets**: Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon tokens

**The challenge**: Each asset type requires different inheritance strategies. A one-size-fits-all approach won't work.
